## Decription

In this game, you need to eliminate enemy ships, before they kill you! Every shot from enemy that hits us, takes 10% of our max health. Also, we have 5 lives, that symbolize how many enemy ship can go through bottom line. As we manage to kill enemies, levels are gonna go up and there will be much more enemies spawning. When we finally end up dead, on the terminal shows up a database with all saved scores and with our score added.
